## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Daily Email Integration (1-2 weeks)
#### Goals
- Implement daily email delivery of top AI stories
- Set up basic story database
- Initialize scoring system

#### Technical Tasks
1. Database Implementation
```sql
-- Stories table
CREATE TABLE stories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    source TEXT NOT NULL,
    interesting_score FLOAT NOT NULL,
    published_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    used_in_email BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

-- Story metrics table
CREATE TABLE story_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    story_id INTEGER REFERENCES stories(id),
    email_opens INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    link_clicks INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    time_spent FLOAT,
    feedback_score FLOAT,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

2. Email Integration
- Set up SendGrid/Mailgun integration
- Create HTML email templates
- Implement APScheduler for daily story compilation
- Track email metrics (opens, clicks)

3. Scoring System v1
- Initial scoring based on:
  * Keyword relevance to business/AI integration
  * Source credibility
  * Story freshness
  * Initial user engagement metrics

### Phase 2: Podcast Analytics Integration (2-3 weeks)
#### Goals
- Collect and analyze podcast engagement data
- Link stories to episode performance
- Begin refining interesting score based on listener behavior

#### Technical Tasks
1. Podcast Analytics Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE episodes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    publish_date DATE NOT NULL,
    stories_discussed INTEGER[],  -- References stories.id
    total_listens INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    avg_retention FLOAT,
    peak_retention_timestamp INTEGER,
    feedback_summary TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE episode_segments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    episode_id INTEGER REFERENCES episodes(id),
    story_id INTEGER REFERENCES stories(id),
    segment_start INTEGER,  -- timestamp in seconds
    segment_end INTEGER,
    retention_rate FLOAT,
    engagement_score FLOAT
);
```

2. Analytics Integration
- Spotify for Podcasters API integration
- Apple Podcasts Connect integration
- Weekly ETL jobs for data aggregation

### Phase 3: Enhanced Recommendation Engine (3-4 weeks)
#### Goals
- Implement ML-based scoring system
- Create analytics dashboard
- Generate automated insights

#### Technical Tasks
1. ML Model Development
- Feature engineering pipeline
- Model training infrastructure
- A/B testing framework for score validation

2. Dashboard Implementation
- Story performance metrics
- Episode analytics
- Trend analysis
- Recommendation explanations

### Phase 4: User Experience & Scale (3-4 weeks)
#### Goals
- Mobile optimization
- Email recipient feedback system
- Prepare for cloud migration

## Cloud Migration Strategy

### Triggers for Cloud Migration
Consider cloud migration when:
1. Database size exceeds 1GB
2. Daily active users > 100
3. Email sending volume > 1000/month
4. Processing time for story scoring > 30 seconds

### Cost-Effective Cloud Strategy
1. Initial Setup (Minimal Cost)
   - Use AWS Free Tier or equivalent
   - Serverless functions for periodic tasks
   - Minimal database instance size

2. Progressive Scaling
   - Start with single region
   - Use spot instances where possible
   - Implement caching to reduce database load
   - Monitor usage patterns to optimize resources

3. Cost Control Measures
   - Set up cost alerts and budgets
   - Implement auto-scaling with strict limits
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries and indexes

### Local vs Cloud Cost Analysis
#### Keep Local When:
- User base < 100
- Database size < 1GB
- Processing time acceptable
- Email volume < 1000/month

#### Consider Cloud When:
- Need for high availability
- Database backup requirements increase
- Multiple geographic regions needed
- Processing requirements exceed local capacity
